    <h2>Typing Test for 2 minutes</h2>
    <div class="text-box" id="text">
        A typing test is a simple assessment designed to measure how many words you can type in one minute,
         also known as your Words Per Minute or WPM score. It also evaluates how accurately you type those words.
        You will typically see a passage of text that you need to type as quickly and correctly as possible.
